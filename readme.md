# Typing Dead

## MVPs

Typing Dead is a typing game where waves of zombies spawn in from the left and have words attached to them, as the player character defends him/herself from the right. As words are properly typed by the player, the zombie with that word will die, keeping the player safe from harm.

 - Players will see zombies shuffle in from the left
 - Players will be able to type to kill zombies
 - Zombies should continuously spawn until the round ends or until the player loses

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**
  Figure out how to get the elements I want on the screen, such as the typing form, zombies, player character, and health.  
  Set up a very basic outline of what I want the game to be.

**Day 2**
  Hopefully, get zombies to move across the screen with the words attached to them.  
  Figure out how to get them to die when the correct word is typed.  
  Get health to go down when zombies reach the player character.

**Day 3**
  Get artwork, music, and other assets into my project. Work out any bugs that might still exist or pop up.
