# Typing Dead

## MVPs

Typing Dead is a typing game where waves of zombies spawn in from the left and have words attached to them, as the player character defends him/herself from the right. As words are properly typed by the player, the zombie with that word will die, keeping the player safe from harm.

 - Players will see zombies shuffle in from the left
 - Players will be able to type to kill zombies
 - Zombies should continuously spawn until the round ends or until the player loses
